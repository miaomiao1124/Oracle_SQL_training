LibBook business requirement,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The main idea is to introduce three types of memberships (corporate, student, individual)although more may be introduced later. Student membership is free.Corporate and Faculty memberships incur a fee but entitle the member to privileges. The type of membership can be changed only if sufficient justification is provided.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Business Rule: Members will pay membership fees,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Constraint: Members can belong to one of the three types of membership(corporate, student, individual)",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Business Rule: student membership is free. Corporate and Faculty memberships incur a fee,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constraint: The type of membership can be changed only if sufficient justification is provided,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Problem:1: The membership base is currently unstable, which is a concern that needs to be addressed by the system.2.Although more types of memberships may be added later, currently only three are available, and they come with specific conditions (e.g., fees, privileges).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Star Care Hospital scenario,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Business Rules:1Every doctor registed with unique ID must started wih letter""DC""2.Every doctor must have a minimum of seven years of working experience before the can be registered.3. Every patient have to register with the hospital on their first vist.4. When register , each patient will be assigned a unique patient number which must start with letters""PT""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Constraint: 1. Unique doctor ID must start with""DC""2. Doctor must have minimum of seven years working experience.3. Unique patient ID must start with""PT""4. every patient must register when first vist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Problem. It will be a potential challenge to ensure doctors have at least seven years of working experience. Because the verification process is not automated human error may happen. 2. Since every patient must register and receive a unique ID on their first visit, any delays in the registration process could lead to longer wait times for patients",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Task1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDENT COURSE DETAIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"CourseID (Primary Key, Foreign Key, mandatory) - Unique identifier for the course.","StudentID (Primary Key, Foreign Key, mandatory) - Unique identifier for the student.",Grade (mandatory) - The grade received for the course,"GradeDate (Primary Key, mandatory) - The date when the grade was assigned (helps track changes over time).",,,,,,,,,,
ERDish for Relationships:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"STUDENT COURSE DETAIL maintains a many-to-many relationship between STUDENT and COURSE, but now it includes the GradeDate attribute to allow multiple grades to be tracked for the same course.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Task2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a. Why is the start time part of the UID of ASSIGNMENT?,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The start time is part of the unique identifier (UID) of the ASSIGNMENT entity because the combination of Date of Exam and Start Time uniquely identifies a specific instance of an assignment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
b. Name at least three time-related constraints.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1.End Time must be later than Start Time:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Constraint: The End Time of an exam must always be later than the Start Time.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conditional Non-Transferability: This constraint is not about transferability but is a logical constraint to ensure that the duration of an exam is valid.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2.Exams on the Same Date in the Same Classroom Should Not Overlap:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Constraint: If two exams are scheduled in the same Class Room on the same Date of Exam, their times must not overlap. This means that one exam must end before the next one begins.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conditional Non-Transferability: This constraint implies that time slots for classroom assignments cannot be reused or transferred if they overlap with another assignment.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3.Minimum Duration Between Exams in the Same Classroom:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Constraint: There should be a minimum gap (e.g., 15 minutes) between the end of one exam and the start of another in the same classroom. This allows for setup or transition time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Conditional Non-Transferability: This constraint ensures that there is adequate time between assignments, preventing the direct transfer of time slots without considering this gap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Task1,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Color column contains multiple values in some rows, which violates the 1NF requirement of atomicity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each combination of Item ID and Color should have its own row.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Task2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Location attribute is dependent only on Store ID and not on the full composite key (Supplier ID and Store ID). This violates the rule of 2NF, which states that all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Identify Partial Dependencies:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Location is partially dependent on Store ID alone, not on the entire composite key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remove Partial Dependencies:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To remove the partial dependency, we need to split the table into two separate tables.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Store Table:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This table will store the relationship between Store ID and Location.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Store ID,Location,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Task3,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The table violates the Third Normal Form (3NF) because of the transitive dependency. Specifically, Category Desc depends on Category ID, and Category ID is not the primary key but a non-key attribute. This means Category Desc is indirectly dependent on the primary key Book ID through Category ID.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Identify Transitive Dependencies:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Category Desc is transitively dependent on Book ID through Category ID.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remove Transitive Dependencies:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To remove the transitive dependency, separate the table into two tables: one for the relationship between Category ID and Category Desc, and another for the relationship between Book ID, Category ID, and Price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Book Table:This table will store the relationship between Book ID, Category ID, and Price.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exercise2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1. Evaluate the Entities Against the Rules of Normalization:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1NF: The entity is in 1NF as all the attributes contain atomic values.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2NF: The entity is in 2NF because the primary key is not composite, so all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3NF: There are no transitive dependencies, so it complies with 3NF.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
PARENT INFORMATION,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1NF: The entity is in 1NF as all attributes are atomic.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2NF: The entity is in 2NF because the primary key is not composite.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3NF: The entity complies with 3NF, as there are no transitive dependencies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
STUDENT COURSE DETAIL,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1NF: This entity lacks a clear primary key, which is required for 1NF. We need a composite key of StudentID and CourseID to properly normalize it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2NF: Assuming a composite key of StudentID and CourseID, Grade would be fully dependent on the composite key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
3NF: The entity would be in 3NF with the composite key since there would be no transitive dependencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DEPARTMENT,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1NF, 2NF, 3NF: The entity complies with all forms of normalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
FACULTY,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1NF, 2NF, 3NF: The entity complies with all forms of normalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
COURSE,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1NF, 2NF, 3NF: The entity complies with all forms of normalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
ONLINE / SEATED (Subtypes of COURSE),,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1NF, 2NF, 3NF: The subtypes comply with all forms of normalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXAM,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1NF, 2NF, 3NF: The entity complies with all forms of normalization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
EXAM RESULT,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"1NF: This entity lacks a clear primary key, which is required for 1NF. We need a composite key of StudentID and ExamID to properly normalize it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2NF: Assuming a composite key of StudentID and ExamID, Grade would be fully dependent on the composite key.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
3NF: The entity would be in 3NF with the composite key since there would be no transitive dependencies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Explanation of Violations:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1NF Violations: Occur when there are missing or unclear primary keys that prevent proper identification of rows.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"2NF Violations: Occur when non-key attributes depend on only part of a composite primary key, which wasn’t seen here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"3NF Violations: Occur when non-key attributes depend on other non-key attributes (transitive dependency), which wasn't observed in the primary entities but might occur in subtypes if not handled properly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
